Allows you to save and load three different savegames in Kingdom: New Lands.
I made this project to help me test the mods I am working on.

Troubleshooting:

Problem: ItS NoT RuNnInG.
Solution(s): Run as administrator, install Java, or run the .jar file under compiled directly with javac.exe.

Problem: ThE TiMeS aRe WrOnG.
Solution: Ignore it, JVM is messy with timezone finding.

Problem: ItS NoT SaVeInG/LoAdInG.
Solution: Run as administrator.

This project should be really easy to modify for any game that uses single-file based savegames.

Uninstallation Instructions:
Delete this folder and it's contents.

If you want everything uninstalled from this program:
Go to C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\noio\Kingdom
Delete the Saves folder, (This will not get rid of your current savegame!).
